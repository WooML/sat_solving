Competitive activities can be more than just performance showcases which the best is recognized and the rest are overlooked.	0
The provision of timely, constructive feedback to participants on performance is an asset that some competitions and contests offer.	1
In a sense, all competitions give feedback.	1
For many, this is restricted to information about whether the participant is an award- or prizewinner.	1
The provision of that type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to demonstrating superior performance but not necessarily excellence.	1
The best competitions promote excellence, not just winning or “beating” others.	1
The emphasis on superiority is what we typically see as fostering a detrimental effect of competition.	1
Performance feedback requires that the program go beyond the “win, place, or show” level of feedback.	1
Information about performance can be very helpful, not only to the participant who does not win or place but also to those who do.	1
People from more individualistic cultural contexts tend to be motivated to maintain self-focused agency or control 1 as these serve as the basis of one’s self-worth.	1
With this form of agency comes the belief that individual successes 2 depending primarily on one’s own abilities and actions, and thus, whether by influencing the environment or trying to accept one’s circumstances, the use of control ultimately centers on the individual.	0
The independent self may be more 3 driven to cope by appealing to a sense of agency or control.	1
However, people from more interdependent cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and harmony.	1
Research has shown 4 that East Asians prefer to receive, but not seek, more social support rather than seek personal control in certain cases.	1
Therefore, people 5 who hold a more interdependent self-construal may prefer to cope in a way that promotes harmony in relationships.	1
Regulations covering scientific experiments on human subjects are strict.	1
Subjects must give their informed, written consent, and experimenters must submit their proposed experiments to thorough examination by overseeing bodies.	1
Scientists who experiment on themselves can, functionally if not legally, avoid the restrictions associated with experimenting on other people.	1
They can also sidestep most of the ethical issues involved: nobody, presumably, is more aware of an experiment’s potentia hazards than the scientist who devised it.	1
Nonetheless, experimenting on oneself remains deeply problematic.	1
One obvious drawback is the danger involved; knowing that it exists does nothing to reduce it.	1
A less obvious drawback is the limited range of data that the experiment can generate.	1
Human anatomy and physiology vary, in small but significant ways, according to gender, age, lifestyle, and other factors.	1
"Experimental results derived from a single subject are, therefore,
of limited value; there is no way to know what the subject’s responses are typical or atypical of the response of humans as a group."	0
Most historians of science point to the need for a reliable calendar to regulate agricultural activity as the motivation for learning about what we now call astronomy, the study of stars and planets.	1
"Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans their 
first formal method of recording the passage of time."	1
Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit.	1
The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons.	1
The stones may even have been used to predict eclipses.	1
The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and discovers deeper meanings in events.	0
Accepting whatever others are communicating only pays off if their interests correspond to ours ―think cells in a body, bees in a beehive.	1
As far as communication between humans is concerned, such commonality of interests is rarely achieved; even a pregnant mother has reasons to mistrust the chemical signals sent by her fetus.	1
Fortunately, there are ways of making communication work even in the most adversarial of relationships.	1
A prey can convince a predator not to chase it.	1
But for such communication to occur, there must be strong guarantees which those who receive the signal will be better off believing it.	0
The messages have to be kept, on the whole, honest.	1
In the case of humans, honesty is maintained by a set of cognitive mechanisms that evaluate communicated information.	1
These mechanisms allow us to accept most beneficial messages ―to be open ―while rejecting most harmful messages ―to be vigilant.	1
Like whole individuals, cells have a life span.	1
During their life cycle (cell cycle), cell size, shape, and metabolic activities can change dramatically.	1
A cell is “born” as a twin when its mother cell divides, producing two daughter cells.	1
Each daughter cell is smaller than the mother cell, and except for unusual cases, each grows until it becomes as large as the mother cell was.	1
During this time, the cell absorbs water, sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients and assembles them into new, living protoplasm.	1
After the cell has grown to the proper size, its metabolism shifts as it either prepares to divide or matures and differentiates into a specialized cell.	1
Both growth and development require a complex and dynamic set of interactions involving all cell parts.	1
What cell metabolism and structure should be complex would not be surprising, but actually, they are rather simple and logical.	0
Even the most complex cell has only a small number of parts, each responsible for a distinct, well-defined aspect of cell life.	1
Ecosystems differ in composition and extent. They can be defined as ranging from the communities and interactions of organisms in your mouth or those in the canopy of a rain forest to all those in Earth’s oceans.	1
The processes governing them differ in complexity and speed.	1
There are systems that turn over in minutes, and there are others which rhythmic time xtends to hundreds of years.	0
Some ecosystems are extensive (‘biomes’, such as the African savanna); some cover regions (river basins); many involve clusters of villages (micro-watersheds); others are confined to the level of a single village (the village pond).	1
In each example there is an element of indivisibility.	1
Divide an ecosystem into parts by creating barriers, and the sum of the productivity of the parts will typically be found to be lower than the productivity of the whole, other things being equal.	1
The mobility of biological populations is a reason.	1
Safe passages, for example, enable migratory species to survive.	1
Recognizing ethical issues is the most important step in understanding business ethics.	1
An ethical issue is an identifiable problem, situation, or opportunity that requires a person to choose from among several actions that may be evaluated as right or wrong, ethical or unethical.	1
Learn how to choose from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good personal values, but also knowledge competence in the business area of concern	0
Employees also need to know when to rely on their organizations’ policies and codes of ethics or have discussions with co-workers or managers on appropriate conduct.	1
Ethical decision making is not always easy because there are always gray areas that create dilemmas, no matter how decisions are made.	1
For instance, should an employee report on a co-worker engaging in time theft?	1
Should a salesperson leave out facts about a product’s poor safety record in his presentation to a customer?	1
Such questions require the decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and decide whether to ask for guidance.	1
Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals to restage themselves, representing occasions for change.	1
To understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a basis for change.	1
The most common explanation offered by my informants as to why fashion is so appealing is that it constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery.	1
Clothes are part of how people present them to the world, and fashion locates them in the present, relative to what is happening in society and to fashion’s own history.	0
As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the meanings associated with specific pieces of clothing.	1
Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of self-expression: clothes can be inexpensively purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if none of these is true.	1
Fashion can also strengthen agency in various ways, opening up space for action.	1
Consider The Wizard of Oz as a psychological study of motivation.	1
Dorothy and her three friends work hard to get to the Emerald City, overcoming barriers, persisting against all adversaries.	1
They do so because they expect the Wizard to give them what they are missing.	1
Instead, the wonderful (and wise) Wizard makes them aware that they, not he, always had the power to fulfill their wishes.	1
For Dorothy, home is not a place but a feeling of security, of comfort with people she loves; it is wherever her heart is.	1
The courage the Lion wants, the intelligence the Scarecrow longs for, and the emotions the Tin Man dreams of being attributes they already possess.	0
They need to think about these attributes not as internal conditions but as positive ways in which they are already relating to others.	1
After all, didn’t they demonstrate those qualities on the journey to Oz, a journey motivated by little more than an expectation, an idea about the future likelihood of getting something they wanted?	1
